              Toby was always interested in very nerdy things; like alarm
              systems, and showed a strong interest in how things worked. He
              would discover how these things worked generally through brute
              force, and would sit looking for patterns on circuit boards of his
              newly destroyed things. This interest turned to code, where Toby
              built his first website at 7 years old. This vanilla HTML website
              took him many days to complete, and looked terrible; but he was
              hooked.

              Toby continued building, and in September 2021, discovered Hack
              Club. In the Summer of 2022, Toby attended their summer event
              called Assemble, in SF. Then, in November of 2022; Toby was hired
              as a Community Engineer at Hack Club, where he worked with an
              awesome team to make the Hack Club community the coolest place to
              be as a teenage programmer. In November 2023, Toby became a
              Storyteller at Hack Club, where he designs and builds websites.
